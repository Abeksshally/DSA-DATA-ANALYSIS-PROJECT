## STEP BY STEP DOCUMENTATION EMPLOYED DURING THE PROJECT

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Objectives:

- Clean and analyze sales and customer data.
 
- Answer business questions around profitability, customer retention, and logistics.
 
- Generate strategic recommendations based on real performance trends.

- Support customer-centric and cost-efficient decision-making.


Case Scenarios Covered:

1. Identify top-performing product categories.
2. Analyze regional performance and recommend targeted strategies.
3. Evaluate product sales in specific regions (e.g., appliances in Ontario).
4. Recommend strategies to engage low-spending customers.
5. Analyze efficiency of shipping methods based on order priority.
6. Profile high-spending or loyal customers.
7. Recommend retention strategies for top clients.
8. Leverage frequent buyers for loyalty programs or subscriptions.
9. Model a profitable customer persona based on behavior.
10. Understand return behavior and its impact on cost.
11. Recommend logistics restructuring for optimal delivery performance.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the process of exploring and understanding a dataset before doing any modeling. It helps you:

- Understand the data's structure and patterns

- Find missing values or outliers

- Visualize trends using charts and graphs

- Prepare data for further analysis

- It often involves statistics, data cleaning, and visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

### Step 1: Step 1: Creation of Database and Data Importation
Approach:

create database DSA_PROJECT_DB

Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Import Wizard to load the KMS Sql Case Study.csv file into a table named DBO.[KMS Sql Case Study].

Actions:

Right-clicked on the target database â†’ Tasks â†’ Import Flat File.

Set data types, adjusted column names, and validated data rows.

create Database DSAproject_db

select top 10 * from dbo.[KMS Sql Case Study]

    [Ship_Mode],
    COUNT(*) AS NumOrders,
    SUM([Shipping_Cost]) AS Total_Shipping_Cost
FROM 
    dbo.[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY 
    [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
ORDER BY 
    [Order_Priority], Total_Shipping_Cost DESC;


### KEY INSIGHTS:
- Technology emerged as the highest revenue-generating product category.
- Top 3 Regions outperform others and should be prioritized for new launches.
- Low-spending customers can be activated through bundling, loyalty offers, and personalized recommendations.
- Express Air is being misused for low-priority orders, leading to cost inefficiencies.
- High-frequency buyers are ideal candidates for subscription-based services.
- Return behaviors suggest improvement is needed in product clarity and customer communication.

### TRENDS & PATTERNS
- Appliance sales vary by region, indicating the need for location-specific marketing.
- Shipping method mismatch (e.g., high-cost methods used for non-urgent orders) highlights optimization opportunities.
- Customer segmentation shows that behavior-based strategies can boost retention and order value.

### STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
- Marketing: Promote technology bundles and upsell to top buyers.
- Operations: Create shipping rules tied to order urgency to reduce logistics costs.
- Customer Retention: Launch loyalty programs for top-tier customers and reactivation strategies for dormant ones.
- Logistics: Shift low-priority deliveries to cost-efficient shipping methods.

- Product Strategy: Use purchase and return trends to optimize product mix and descriptions.
